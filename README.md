# Restaurant-Reviews-Hackathon

5h hackathon I worked on as part of Brainstation web development program. We had 5h to create an application that would use react-app, express server and our own API. This was made with the intent to learn to work collaboratively. We used github workflow to manage the project.

We created this mock restaurant review app with a star wars theme.

I worked with bsnelling9 and stang1207.

To run the program run the following in the root directory:
<br>
`$npm install all`
<br>
<br>
`$ npm run dev`

PORT of server is 8000
